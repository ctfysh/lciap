# 基本原理

### 1. 特征化因子（潜势因子）

`$$\frac{{\Delta_{{{\text{Impact}}}}}}{{\Delta_{{{\text{Emission}}\;{\text{flow}}_{i}}}}}{\left[{\frac{{{\text{PDF}}\cdot{\text{m}}^{3}}}{{{\text{kg}}_{{{\text{emitted}}}}/{\text{year}}}}}\right]}={\underbrace{{\left({{\sum\limits_j{{\underbrace{\frac{{\Delta M_{{i,j}}}}{{\Delta S_{i}}}{\left[{\frac{{{\text{kg}}_{{{\text{in}}\;{\text{water}}}}}}{{{\text{kg}}_{{{\text{emitted}}}}/{\text{year}}}}}\right]}}_{{{\text{FF}}i,j}}}}}}\right)}}_{{{\text{FF}}_{i}}}}\times{\underbrace{\frac{{\Delta{\text{PDF}}}}{{\Delta C}}{\left[{\frac{{{\text{PDF}}}}{{{\text{kg}}_{{{\text{in}}\;{\text{water}}}}/{\text{m}}^{3}}}}\right]}}_{{{\text{EF}}}}}$$`

### 2. 归趋因子

`$${\text{F}}{{\text{F}}_{i,j}}=\dfrac{\Delta{M_{i,j}}}{S_i}$$`
]

.pull-right[
### 3. 效应因子

`$${\text{E}}{{\text{F}}_j}=\dfrac{\Delta{\text{PD}}{{\text{F}}_j}\cdot{V_j}}{\Delta{M_j}}=\dfrac{\Delta{\text{PD}}{{\text{F}}_j}\cdot{V_j}}{\Delta{C_j}\cdot{V_j}}=\dfrac{\Delta{\text{PD}}{{\text{F}}_j}}{\Delta{C_j}}$$`

# 归趋因子计算方法

.pull-left[
### 1. 归趋因子

`$${\text{F}}{{\text{F}}_i}=\sum\limits_j{{\text{F}}{{\text{F}}_{i,j}}}=\sum\limits_j{{f_{i,j}}\cdot{\tau_j}}$$`

### 2. 区域平均归趋因子

`$${\text{FF}}_{\text{region}}^{\text{average}}=\frac{1}{{\sum\limits_l{{E_l}}}}\cdot\sum\limits_l{{\text{F}}{{\text{F}}_l}}\cdot{E_l}$$`
]

### 3. 停留时间

`$${\tau_j}=\frac{1}{{{k_{{\text{adv,}}j}}+{k_{{\text{ret,}}j}}+{k_{{\text{use,}}j}}}}$$`

### 4. 输移比例

`$${f_{i,j}}=\prod\limits_{l=i}^{j-1}{\frac{{{k_{{\text{adv,}}l}}}}{{{k_{{\text{adv,}}l}}+{k_{{\text{ret,}}l}}+{k_{{\text{use,}}l}}}}}$$`

# 归趋因子的理解与推导

归趋因子（fate factor，FF）表示的是上游排放单元在单位排放速率下引起的下游接收单元物质的增加量。如果记上游的排放单元编号为 `\(i\)` ，下游的接收单元编号为 `\(j\)`，单位时间排放量为 `\(S_{i}\)`（单位： `\(\text{kg day}^{-1}\)`），引起的物质增加量为 `\(M_{j}\)`（单位：kg），那么归趋因子的计算公式为：

`$$FF_{i,j}=M_{j}/S_{i}$$`
 
另外，根据物质在某个单元格的停留时间 `\(\tau_i\)`的计算公式

`$$\tau_i=M_{i}/S_{i}=FF_{i,i}$$`

可以得到停留时间与归趋因子的直接关系。从而有

`$$\dfrac{FF_{i,j}}{FF_{j,j}}=\dfrac{S_{j}}{S_{i}}=f_{i,j}$$`

这里 `\(f_{i,j}\)`表示下游传输量占上游传输量的比例，根据该表达式可以得到 `\(f_{i,i}=1\)`以及

`$$FF_{i,j}=f_{i,j}\cdot FF_{j,j}=f_{i,j}\tau_{j}$$`

# 效应因子的理解（1）

`\({EF}_j\)`为效应因子（effect factor），表示水体中单位污染物浓度的增加所带来的物种潜在消失可能性（potential disappeared fraction of species, PDF）的变化，单位为 `\(m^3\cdot kg^{-1}\)`。 `\(EF\)`定义式如下：

`$$EF=\frac{\partial PDF}{\partial C}=1-\frac{\partial RSR}{\partial C}$$`

而 `\(PDF\)`可以通过log-logistic回归来建立其与污染物浓度 `\(C\)`的关系，具体为：

`$$\log\frac{PDF}{1-PDF}=\frac{\log_{10}C-\alpha}{\beta}$$`

其中 `\(\alpha\)`为 `\(PDF=0.5\)`时 `\(\log_{10}C\)`的值， `\(\beta\)`为回归方程的斜率，表示物种变化对于污染物浓度变化的敏感性，值越大越不敏感。将这个式子变形可以得到

`$$PDF=\frac{1}{1+\exp\left(-\frac{\log_{10}C-\alpha}{\beta}\right)}=\frac{1}{1+e^{\alpha/\beta}C^{-1/\left(\beta\log10\right)}}$$`

.footnote[注意：ES&amp;T论文中将PDF写成PNOF（the fraction of potentially not occurring or the disappeared fraction of species）。]

---

# 效应因子的理解（2）

若令 `\(a=e^{\alpha/\beta}\)`和 `\(b=1/\left(\beta\log10\right)\)`，则

`$$PDF=\frac{1}{1+aC^{-b}}$$`

由此可知

`$$EF=\frac{\partial PDF}{\partial C}=PDF\cdot\left(1-PDF\right)\cdot\frac{1}{C\beta\log10}=\frac{abC^{-b-1}}{\left(1+aC^{-b}\right)^{2}}$$`

由于 `\(PDF\)`是单调增函数，所以 `\(EF&gt;0\)`，即 `\(\beta&gt;0\)`（因为 `\(a&gt;0\)`恒成立，而 `\(b&gt;0\)`则 `\(\beta&gt;0\)`）。

另外还有两种计算 `\(EF\)`的方式：

.pull-left[
- 线性：
`$$EF=0.5/10^\alpha$$`
]
.pull-right[
- 平均值：
`$$EF=PDF/C$$`
]
